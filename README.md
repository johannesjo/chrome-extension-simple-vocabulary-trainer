Simple vocabulary trainer using chrome notifications. Uses a custom vocabulary list to remind you in a given interval of your vocabulary.

## how it works
You define a custom vocabulary list. The browser will send you little notifications with a random entry every X seconds, letting you practise a little while you're doing something else.  

## getting started
1. [Download from the chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-vocabulary-trainer/gpbkfeonfeclpaleaiepgeejnjogpidg)
2. Click on the icon
3. Paste your Vocabulary into the textarea.

**Example how to write down your vocabulary**
```
Bier: beer 
Wasser: water
Einhorn: unicorn
```

## how to get word lists
Search the internet. There probably should be some resource out there that you can use.
